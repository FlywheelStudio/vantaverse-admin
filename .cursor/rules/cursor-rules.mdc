How to add new cursor rules to our Supabase project

1. Always place rule files in PROJECT_ROOT/.cursor/rules/:

   ```
   .cursor/rules/
   ├── your-rule-name.mdc
   ├── another-rule.mdc
   └── ...
   ```

2. Follow the naming convention:

   - Use kebab-case for filenames
   - Always use .mdc extension
   - Make names descriptive of the rule's purpose

3. Directory structure:

   ```
   PROJECT_ROOT/
   ├── .cursor/
   │   └── rules/
   │       ├── your-rule-name.mdc
   │       └── ...
   ├── supabase/
   │   ├── config.toml
   │   └── schemas/
   │       └── schema.sql
   └── ...
   ```

4. Never place rule files:

   - In the project root
   - In subdirectories outside .cursor/rules
   - In any other location

-Query examples:
Use the following query to get exercises for a day in a simple JSON object. The following query gets Monday's exercises of the first week:
select schedule[1][1] from workout_schedules where id = 'YOUR WORKOUT SCHEDULE ID'
Returns the array of ordered exercises for the day:
{
   "exercises":[
      {
         "id":"7c670ab2-c6e7-4998-97db-10494c1e4831",
         "type":"exercise_template"
      },
      {
         "id":"13addd79-e446-4612-a5b6-7da02e08f9c2",
         "type":"exercise_template"
      },
      {
         "id":"bcc869d3-414f-4c76-8a57-ddb19723184c",
         "type":"exercise_template"
      }
   ]
}
Tuesdays of the first week, we change the second index:
select schedule[1][2] from workout_schedules where id = 'YOUR WORKOUT SCHEDULE ID'
Mondays of the second week:
select schedule[2][1] from workout_schedules where id = 'YOUR WORKOUT SCHEDULE ID'

To query an entire week is a bit more tricky; this queries the entire first week:
select schedule[1:1] from workout_schedules where id = '6b8c44ee-20d5-41c4-9c58-ae945ba684ea'
Returns an ordered multidimensional array for the week. This week is (I only assigned exercises to monday):
[
   [
      {
         "exercises":[
            {
               "id":"7c670ab2-c6e7-4998-97db-10494c1e4831",
               "type":"exercise_template"
            },
            {
               "id":"13addd79-e446-4612-a5b6-7da02e08f9c2",
               "type":"exercise_template"
            },
            {
               "id":"bcc869d3-414f-4c76-8a57-ddb19723184c",
               "type":"exercise_template"
            }
         ]
      },
      {
         "exercises":[]
      },
      {
         "exercises":[]
      },
      {
         "exercises":[]
      },
      {
         "exercises":[]
      },
      {
         "exercises":[]
      },
      {
         "exercises":[]
      }
   ]
]
The following queries the second week:
select schedule[2:2] from workout_schedules where id = '6b8c44ee-20d5-41c4-9c58-ae945ba684ea'
Notice how we changed both values to the 1 index week number, this returns:
[
   [
      {
         "exercises":[
            {
               "id":"e4758130-73b3-4f44-a400-54bf3808f4d0",
               "type":"group"
            }
         ]
      },
      {
         "exercises":[]
      },
      {
         "exercises":[]
      },
      {
         "exercises":[]
      },
      {
         "exercises":[]
      },
      {
         "exercises":[]
      },
      {
         "exercises":[]
      }
   ]
]

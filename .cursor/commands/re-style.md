Elements must be consistant, font tipography must be consistant, focus on highlighting elements in the foreground and background with appropiate colors
Keep fonts consistant, use weight and colors to emphasize / deemphasize
Refactor any shadcn elements used in these pages if needed to follow our design system and layout @design-system.json (272-290) 
If there is a color, it should be picked from our pallet @design-system.json (53-172) 
If there is a font, it should be sized based on our scale @design-system.json (206-271) 
If there is spacing, it should respect our gridUnits @design-system.json (173-189)
